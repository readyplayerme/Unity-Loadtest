# Ready Player Me Avatars Loadtest

This sample project shows the performance of different speced Ready Player Me avatars in a Web-GL environment. It is possible to spawn up to 200 different avatars into the same scene to see how it affects the performance of the scene. 

This can also be embedded in your game or app, to see the performance of multiple avatars your game-scene.

## How to use the avatar loader

### Avatar Loader

1. On the left side-bar you can find the avatar loader
2. First you select the amount of avatars you want to spawn in the scene (1-200).
3. Second you choose a avatar-configuration (Low, Medium, High). When you select a config, you can see it's values in the box below. Currently it is not possible to change each individual parameter.
4. When you are ready, you can hit the "Load Avatars" button.
5. Avatar loading starts. You can see a white avatar silhuette in the scene. This marks the next avatar spawning, once it's loaded.

### State

1. On the right side bar you can find the stats window which should be pretty self explanatory.
